Donfig
======

is based on work originally done in the :doc:`dask <dask:configuration>` library for
configuring itself and its subpackages. Donfig is a python library meant to
make configuration easier for other python packages. Donfig can be configured
programmatically, by environment variables, or from YAML files in standard
locations.
